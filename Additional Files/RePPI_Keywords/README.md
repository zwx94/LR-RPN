There are 81 different elements about reconstructing reliable bio-network in this repositor

Here, we give an example of the naming rules of file as follows:

file name: RePPI_LambdaEta_i_j.mat
		i --> lambda
		j --> eta
		this file save a reconstructed bio-network, which was get by RWRH(lambda=i,eta=j)
		Seeing section of 2.2 in our paper for detail information
